RFStockalike
============

This is a set of configs for the [Real Fuels mod](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64118) designed to fit in with stock. This will be best with stock and stock-aligned mods, on a stock-scaled Kerbin or 6.4x sized Kerbin.

If you play stock, you should set the Real Fuels setting useRealisticMass = false in RealSettings.cfg. If you play with the 6.4x scale Kerbin, leave that setting as default.

This does require Real Fuels to be installed as well as ModuleManager 2.x. If you have Real Fuels running already, you have everything you need.

Installation
------------

Install the configs to the <KSP root>/GameData/RealFuels/ folder, and install the ModuleRCSFX folder to <KSP root>/GameData/.

If you wish to not have the RCS changed (and still use MonoPropellant), do not install the ModuleRCSFX folder and remove the StockAlike_RCS_RF.cfg and Mono_to_Hydrazine.cfg.
